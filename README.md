The project is going to deal with weather data of the city of London from the period of 1979
to 2020. The attributes in the dataset cover a range of sets starting with date, cloud activity,
sunshine, global radiation, maximum, mean & minimum temperature. Additionally there is
precipitation, pressure and depth of snow measurement.

In this project, the idea is to carry out multiple analysis using python & jupyter notebooks
with all the above mentioned entities. A sample chart is given above which came from
researching the dataset for the maximum and minimum temperature over the years. Other
analysis will include,
- Status of clouds in London,
- Depth of snow in London,
- The Global radiation factor in London,
- Analysis of Temperatures

To see the results, run the code together, and the image will display below each line of code
